# HOUR-GLASS-STAR-PATTERN

Hourglass Star Pattern in C++

This C++ program prints an hourglass-shaped star (*) pattern by combining an inverted triangle on top and a regular triangle at the bottom. The pattern is symmetrical and centered, creating the visual of an hourglass using stars. It utilizes nested loopsâ€”first to handle spaces for alignment and then to print the stars in the correct quantity per row. The number of rows (or the height of each triangle) can be adjusted by changing the value of n. This is a great exercise for understanding nested loop structures, symmetry in patterns, and basic console output formatting in C++.
